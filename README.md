Project Duration: [July 2025]
Role: Data Analyst (Individual Project)

Project Overview:
As part of my data analytics learning journey, I independently designed and developed an interactive and visually compelling Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, a leading instant grocery delivery platform. The goal of the project was to provide business stakeholders with meaningful insights into sales performance, item categories, and outlet operations across different dimensions such as location type, outlet size, item type, and historical data.

Understand product-level performance based on item category, fat content, and availability.

Compare outlet efficiency across different tiers, sizes, and locations.

Present historical trends of outlet growth from 2012 to 2022.

Improve decision-making by providing key business KPIs and dynamic visual exploration.

üìä Dashboard Features & Insights:
KPI Indicators:
